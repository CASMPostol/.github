    <p>CAS has completed the feasibility study entitled: “Establishing of optimal directions, methods, technology, range
        and development rate of telemetric and remote control systems for Warsaw heating system components “. It
        contains two documentations, i.e. “An audit of telemetric and remote control systems in SPEC S.A.&quot; that
        includes among others:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>description of existing telemetric and remote control systems of SPEC S.A. facilities</li>
        <li>analysis of possibilities of existing telemetric and remote control systems extension</li>
        <li>analysis of possibilities of using and extension of the telecommunication and information infrastructure of
            SPEC S.A. for the needs of telemetric and remote control systems</li>
        <li>analysis of possibilities of extension of the Control Room at the Employer's Maintenance Department as a
            monitoring and control central point</li>
        <li>analysis of technical aspects and possibilities of using individual communication technologies (radio, PSTN,
            ISDN, GSM, GPRS, WiFi, WLAN, optical fiber technologies, CTV, Internet, - satellite communication)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The other documentation entitled &quot;Development strategy and directions for the construction of telemetric and
        remote control systems of SPEC S.A.” includes among others:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>development goals of telemetric and remote control systems in Warsaw heating system with a preliminary
            economic analysis of their utilization;</li>
        <li>analysis of possibilities of utilizing the existing systems for the construction of an integrated
            supervision system of telemetry and remote control;</li>
        <li>strategic assumptions for the construction of the integrated system;</li>
        <li>development directions of the integrated control system, in particular:
            <ul>
                <li>adaptation of the facilities of the Control Room at the Employer's Maintenance Department to the
                    requirements of the heating system control and supervision;</li>
                <li>modernization of the communication infrastructure (computer and process networks) with remote access
                    to selected external services;</li>
                <li>remote monitoring and control of network pumping stations with an analysis of the possibility of and
                    demand for an unmanned control system of the pumping stations to be operated automatically and
                    supervised from the Control Room of the Maintenance Department;</li>
                <li>remote control of heating facilities including control of supply areas and dynamic control of load
                    distribution among the sources by means of automatic operation control within a common network;</li>
                <li>large–format visualization and integration of telemetric and remote control systems with management
                    systems of the heating network and company resources, i.e. GIS, CRM and ERP;</li>
                <li>qualitative and quantitative analysis of the possibility for setting parameters of the heating
                    network operation basing on the master optimization system that uses a system of thermal energy
                    demand prediction;</li>
                <li>application for data archiving, integration and reporting systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>prerequisites for the realization of individual systems with an analysis of possible dividing into stages
            and proposed schedule of implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stołeczne Przedsiębiorstwo Energetyki Cieplnej S.A. in Warsaw, the contractor, received documentation that can be
        a basis for determination of technical guidelines on the Specifications of Significant Order Conditions for the
        implementation of individual automation systems in order to improve the quality of services provided to the
        customers.</p>
